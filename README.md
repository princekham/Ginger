Based on this, the months of March to September seem to have the ideal average temperatures for growing ginger. However, since these are averages, it's important to monitor the actual daily temperatures, especially during the start and end of this range.

For growing ginger in a controlled room, you would need to adjust the temperature mainly in the months of January, February, October, November, and December to maintain it within the optimal range for ginger growth.

Remember, ginger also requires high humidity and well-draining soil, so these conditions should be replicated in your controlled environment as well. Happy gardening!
